## **Hey! I'm Kirby, a Senior Computer Science Major at UCI!** 🐜🍴

I'm currently an SDE Intern @ Amazon working on a full stack project with React, TypeScript, SQL, and AWS Services! Beyond that, I am experienced in Python, C++,
C# for games, and other technologies. I am actively learning about machine learning, augmented reality, and mobile development. 

I actively live my life through this motto:
> "A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing." - Emo Philips
